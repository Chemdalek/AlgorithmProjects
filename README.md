# Hello-World

I am a PhD graduate in computational chemistry, but have found that jobs are scarce using my degree. Because of this, I am trying to broaden my coding skills and move out of being an adjunct instructor and get back to using my brain. I love Doctor Who, being an introvert and spending time with my family. I am most comfortable with C++ and Python, but am still pretty lame at both. I would like to get into AI and data analysis/machine learning with a company, but the idea of learning how to code and possibly understand subjects like neuroscience and robotics would be amazing.
